This folder is the code to reconstruct the 3D scenes from the generated hierarchies.
The input is the file generated by python code, as 'ngenerated model_10Kscenes1.mat'.

Functions:
1. Reconstruct the scenes generated by the trained network. 
The network produces a .mat file <gen_scenes.mat> to record the generated scenes.
(1) Set the filename in util.m.
(2) run main_recon.m.

This script saves the topviews and 3D scenes for every element. 
They are saved in the folders 'recon' and 'images' under the path <code_dir>\0-data\5-generated_scenes\

2. gen3Dscene.m. is to output a list of specified scenes.
1) After running the 'recon.m', you get 'rdataset', a list of generated scenes with an identifier for each object. 
2) Rename it as 'dataset': dataset = rdataset;
3) Set the 'list' variable in gen3Dscene.m, to specify which scenes to be output
4) run gen3Dscene.m.

3. collectPosDis.m. is to show the distribution of relative positions for an object pair.
1) Before running, you need to run the 'recon.m' and rename the 'rdataset' as 'dataset'.
2) set the two label names of the object pairs
3. run collectPosDis.m
